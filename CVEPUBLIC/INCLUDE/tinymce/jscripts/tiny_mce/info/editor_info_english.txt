    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Features:<br>
    </span>
    <ul>

    <br>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Installation:<br>
    </span><ul>
        <li>You may need to chmod TinyMCE-EXP folders to 755 and files to 644 in mambots/editors/tinymce_exp<br>
        if you receive internal server errors with the Image Manager.</li>
        <li>Warning : exp.config.php must remain writable!</li>
        <li>If you want to use a custom_css file for the editor, make a copy of your site template CSS,<br>
        rename it to editor_content.css (or whatever you specify in the paramters) and place it in your<br>
        template css folder. Activate the 'Overide Theme CSS' in paramters.</li>
        <li> Add the following to your template stylesheet so as to be able to have viewable placeholder for Flash files :<br />
        <strong>/* Custom class needed by the flash plugin */<br />
.       mce_plugin_flash {<br />
        border: 1px dotted #cc0000;<br />
        background-image: url(../../../mambots/editors/tinymce_exp/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/flash/images/flash.gif);<br />
        background-position: center;<br />
        background-repeat: no-repeat;<br />
        background-color: #ffffcc;<br />
        }</strong></li>
        </ul></span>
      <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changelog:<br></span><ul>
        <li>Merged Image Manager class files (Transform.php, Files.php, Resize.php & Thumbnails.php) into one file, Functions.php<br />
        to facilitate use of absolute paths for all include and require statements.</li>
        <li>Image Manager now only supports jpeg,png and gif files on upload and edit. This is to aid compatability with GD.</li>
        <li>Removed Popup Link in Advanced Link, which was not working properly. Working on this! :) </li>
        <li>File Manager and Flash Manager now also use absolute paths for include and require statements.</li>
        <li>Popup Image now uses a relative path for the full sized image, which is converted to absolute in the Popup window.</li>
        </ul><br /><br />
